# findCommonAncestors
This is a very basic script to find common ancestors among affected patients by recursively searching through parents.
Please see pedigraphV7.csv for an example of the data file required.

Note: this algorithm searches for common ancestors that appear on both the maternal _and_ paternal sides.
